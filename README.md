Hello,this is my first git test.
Just like Linux os, we use Git by Git Bash.
In this repo, we can see several commands that we can use in Git Bash.
We can see these commands [here](https://github.com/elsieMeng0424/MyFirstGit/blob/main/command.txt).
We need to learn how to manage branches.
You can learn more basic knowledges in https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30044692.

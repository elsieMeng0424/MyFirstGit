Hello,this is my first git test.<br>
Just like Linux os, we use Git by Git Bash.

In this repo, we can see several commands that we can use in Git Bash.
We can see these commands [here](https://github.com/elsieMeng0424/MyFirstGit/blob/main/command.txt).<br>
We also need to learn how to manage branches.
